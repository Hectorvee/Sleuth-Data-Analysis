# Abstract
The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate the application of statistical methods outlined in The Statistical Sleuth by Fred Ramsey and Daniel Schafer. Using a dataset provided in the book, we conduct exploratory data analysis, summarize the key characteristics of the data, and apply appropriate statistical models to investigate the relationships between variables. The results highlight key patterns and provide insights that reinforce the theoretical foundations of the statistical methods. This analysis serves as a practical exercise in data exploration, hypothesis testing, and model building, showcasing the utility of these techniques in solving real-world problems.
